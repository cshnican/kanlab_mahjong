# Kanwisher Lab Mahjong

## Background
Kanwisher Lab Mahjong is mostly cloned and simplified from the Guizhou variation of the Mahjong game. Here we lay out the basic rules, along with some optional rules that might be added to make the game more interesting.

## Objective
Kanwisher Lab Mahjong is a 4-person game. Everyone starts with a number of tokens. 
One game usually lasts 10 minutes. 
During a game, each person has a group of tiles ("牌" in Chinese) in front of them. 
Each person takes turn to draw a tile and discards a tile, until the tile they draw forms a winning pattern (aka "Mahjong"). 
If that's the case, the person having Mahjong first ends the game. 

## Setup
There are 3 suits used in the game: 
- Crack (万/萬): 36 in total, from 1 crack to 9 crack, 4 tiles for each number; "Crack" seems to be short for "character", since this suit is of Chinese characters. ![1 crack](./imgs/1_crack.png | width=100)
